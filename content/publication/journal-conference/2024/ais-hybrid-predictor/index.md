  Accurate short-term prediction of vessel trajectories is critical for navigation safety, traffic management, and collision avoidance. This paper introduces a hybrid predictor that leverages AIS data together with uncertainty modeling to provide robust forecasts under noisy measurements and variable environmental conditions. The method combines a kinematic motion model with a probabilistic neural network that explicitly quantifies prediction uncertainty. Evaluation on large-scale real-world AIS datasets shows the proposed approach significantly reduces trajectory errors and provides reliable confidence bounds compared to conventional data-driven and physics-based baselines.
summary: "A hybrid AIS-based model that integrates kinematics and probabilistic learning for uncertainty-aware short-term ship trajectory forecasting."
