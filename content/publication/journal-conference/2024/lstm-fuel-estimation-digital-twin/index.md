abstract: |
  This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning model for estimating fuel consumption in digital twin ships. The model is trained on historical operational and environmental data to learn vessel-specific patterns and predict fuel usage under varying conditions. The proposed method enables more accurate and adaptive energy management, contributing to smart and sustainable maritime operations.
