  This paper presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a shipboard crane system based on the research vessel R/V Gunnerus. The study integrates sensor data, control logic, and 3D visualization to enable real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. The empirical results demonstrate the digital twin's effectiveness in improving operational safety and decision-making in maritime applications.
