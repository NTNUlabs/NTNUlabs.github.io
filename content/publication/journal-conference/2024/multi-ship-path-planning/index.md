abstract: |
  This study introduces a prediction-enabled path planning framework for handling multi-ship encounter scenarios, with a specific focus on the Oslofjord region. The method integrates short-term trajectory prediction and dynamic risk assessment into a path optimization algorithm, enhancing navigational safety and decision-making in congested maritime areas. Simulation results based on real AIS data validate the effectiveness of the approach.
summary: "A predictive path planning model for multi-ship encounters in Oslofjord, enhancing maritime navigation safety using AIS data."
