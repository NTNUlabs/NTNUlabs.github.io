abstract: |
  This paper proposes a hybrid collision avoidance framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for global decision-making and model-based control for local trajectory optimization. By combining high-level policy learning with low-level control robustness, the system enhances adaptability and safety in dynamic traffic environments. Evaluations in simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional RL or control-only approaches.
summary: "A hybrid reinforcement learning and model-based control approach for enhanced collision avoidance in intelligent transportation."
