  This paper presents data-driven and physics-informed models for estimating the specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) of wellboats used in aquaculture transport. The models aim to enhance the accuracy of energy simulations for operational planning and sustainability assessment. Results indicate the feasibility of applying SFOC models under varying operational and environmental conditions.
summary: "A study on specific fuel oil consumption models for wellboats, improving simulation accuracy in aquaculture logistics."
