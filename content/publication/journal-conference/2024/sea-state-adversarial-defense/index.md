abstract: |
  Accurate estimation of sea state is essential for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous marine vessels. However, AI-powered estimators can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in sensor data, leading to degraded performance under real-world conditions. This paper introduces a novel defense framework that enhances robustness by integrating adversarial training with adaptive smoothing techniques. By simulating both white-box and black-box attacks on radar and vision inputs, the proposed method is shown to significantly reduce estimation error while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on benchmark sea state datasets demonstrate up to a 40% improvement in robustness compared to standard AI models.
summary: "An adversarial defense framework combining adversarial training and adaptive smoothing to improve robustness of AI-based sea state estimation."
