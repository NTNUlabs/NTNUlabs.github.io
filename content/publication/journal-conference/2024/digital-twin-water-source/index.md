abstract: |
  This paper presents an early-stage implementation of a digital twin for a drinking water source in Norway. The system integrates real-time sensor data, simulation models, and predictive analytics to monitor water quality and support proactive management. Designed for scalability and environmental resilience, this digital twin offers a promising tool for sustainable water resource management. The work received the Best Paper Award at ICIEA 2024.
summary: "Award-winning paper presenting a digital twin framework for real-time monitoring and management of Norwegian water sources."
