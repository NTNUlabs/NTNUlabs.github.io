  This paper investigates how hydrodynamic and environmental modeling affects the accuracy of numerical simulations for a novel floating wind turbine installation technique. The study analyzes wave-current interactions, mooring dynamics, and vessel behavior during the installation process. The findings reveal that precise environmental modeling plays a crucial role in assessing feasibility and optimizing operations for offshore renewable energy systems.
summary: "A study on the impact of hydrodynamic and environmental modeling in simulating innovative floating wind installation methods."
