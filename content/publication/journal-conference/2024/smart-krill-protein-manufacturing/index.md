abstract: |
  This paper presents a novel smart manufacturing framework tailored for the processing of Antarctic krill protein. By integrating industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies, data analytics, and intelligent control systems, the framework enhances production efficiency, ensures quality consistency, and promotes sustainability. The proposed system supports real-time monitoring, traceability, and process optimization across multiple production stages, offering a practical path forward for digitalizing marine bioresource processing industries.
