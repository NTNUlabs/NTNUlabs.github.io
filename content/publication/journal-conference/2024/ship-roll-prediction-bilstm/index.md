  This paper presents a short-term prediction model for ship roll motion based on an encoder-decoder Bi-directional LSTM architecture with teacher forcing. The approach is trained on real-world time series data to capture temporal dependencies and improve prediction accuracy in dynamic sea states. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model for real-time maritime motion forecasting, contributing to enhanced vessel stability control and safety.
summary: "A Bi-LSTM-based model with teacher forcing for accurate short-term prediction of ship roll motion in real sea conditions."
