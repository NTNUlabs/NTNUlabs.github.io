  This paper introduces a learning-based framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of ocean surface vessels under multi-step prediction constraints. The proposed method combines recurrent neural networks with constraint-aware optimization to improve trajectory prediction accuracy and stability in complex marine environments. The approach is validated using real-world vessel data, demonstrating superior performance over baseline models.
