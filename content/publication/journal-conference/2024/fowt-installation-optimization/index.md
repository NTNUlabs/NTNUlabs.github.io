  This paper investigates the optimization of onsite installation methods for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs), focusing on how different lifting arrangement strategies and mechanical damping mechanisms affect relative motion between components. Using dynamic simulation and experimental validation, the study demonstrates that tailored lifting strategies combined with tuned damping systems significantly reduce motion amplitude, improving safety and feasibility during offshore deployment operations.
summary: "Study presented at ISOPE 2024 on improving FOWT installation via optimized lifting and damping strategies."
