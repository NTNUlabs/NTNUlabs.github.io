abstract: |
  This paper presents a method for identifying and classifying pairwise ship encounters to facilitate knowledge extraction in maritime navigation scenarios. Using AIS data and trajectory analysis, the approach distinguishes encounter types based on spatial-temporal interaction features and applies machine learning classifiers to categorize them. The study contributes to intelligent traffic monitoring and decision support in marine operations.
summary: "A machine learning-based approach for identifying and classifying pairwise ship encounters using AIS data, aiding maritime navigation analytics."
