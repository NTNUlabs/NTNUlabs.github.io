  This paper proposes SAFENESS, a semi-supervised transfer learning framework for sea state estimation using ship motion data. By combining labeled and unlabeled datasets from multiple sources, the model improves generalizability across different vessels and environmental conditions. The approach leverages deep feature extraction and domain adaptation to enable robust, real-time sea state prediction in intelligent maritime systems.
