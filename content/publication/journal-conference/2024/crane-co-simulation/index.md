  This paper presents a co-simulation framework designed to enhance onboard support for marine operations, using a Palfinger crane path planning scenario as a case study. The method integrates mechanical system simulation with control strategies and environmental inputs, enabling realistic path generation and assessment in dynamic offshore environments. Results demonstrate the systemâ€™s applicability in improving operational efficiency and safety.
summary: "A co-simulation framework for marine operations, demonstrated through Palfinger crane path planning and published in *Simulation*."
