  This paper proposes a novel Multi-AttentionLSTM model to classify multi-ship encounter scenarios based on AIS data. The architecture incorporates multiple attention mechanisms to capture complex spatiotemporal interactions among vessels. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s superior performance in classifying various encounter types, offering improved interpretability and accuracy for real-time maritime navigation support.
