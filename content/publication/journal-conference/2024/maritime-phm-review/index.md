  This paper presents a comprehensive review of prognostics and health management (PHM) strategies for maritime equipment, viewed from the perspective of classification societies. The review covers key technologies, data sources, regulatory considerations, and implementation challenges. It highlights the role of PHM in improving operational reliability, optimizing maintenance, and supporting condition-based class approval processes in the maritime industry.
