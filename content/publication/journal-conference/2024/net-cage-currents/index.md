abstract: |
  This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the behavior of aquaculture net cages under current conditions through both in situ measurements and numerical simulations. The results offer valuable insights into net deformation, flow interaction, and structural dynamics, contributing to the design and operational optimization of offshore aquaculture systems.
summary: "Field measurements and simulations to analyze net cage behavior in currents, aiding aquaculture engineering practices."
