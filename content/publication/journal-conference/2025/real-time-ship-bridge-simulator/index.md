abstract: |
  This paper presents a multi-threaded software framework enabling real-time interaction between users and a high-fidelity ship bridge simulator. By leveraging concurrent processing, the system maintains low-latency control and realistic feedback, supporting research and training scenarios in marine navigation and safety.
summary: "A concurrent framework for low-latency user interaction with a ship bridge simulator at IEEE ICPS 2025."
