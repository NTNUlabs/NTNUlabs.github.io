abstract: |
  Electric vehicles (EVs) play a critical role in the transition to sustainable transportation. Despite significant advancements, EVs continue to face challenges related to limited range, high costs, and insufficient charging infrastructure. This multi-dimensional survey systematically categorizes factors influencing EV range across technical (e.g., battery capacity, vehicle weight, aerodynamics), environmental (e.g., temperature, terrain), user-related (e.g., driving patterns), economic (e.g., battery costs, electricity prices), policy (e.g., incentives, regulations), and cultural dimensions. The findings highlight key determinants and their interactions, offering a holistic framework to guide future research, technological development, and policy formulation aimed at enhancing EV performance and adoption.
summary: "A comprehensive survey examining technical, environmental, behavioral, economic, policy, and cultural determinants of electric vehicle range."
