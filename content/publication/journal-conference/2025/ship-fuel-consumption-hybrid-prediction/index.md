abstract: |
  Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is vital for optimizing operational costs and reducing environmental impact. This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines firstâ€“principles physics-based modeling with expert-augmented neural networks. The physics model captures fundamental hydrodynamic and propulsion characteristics, while the neural network module incorporates domain knowledge from experienced naval engineers to adjust for real-world variabilities such as weather conditions and loading configurations. Validation on full-scale voyage data demonstrates that the hybrid approach significantly outperforms standalone physics or data-driven models, yielding up to 15% reduction in prediction error across diverse operational scenarios.
summary: "Combines physics-based hydrodynamic modeling with expert-enhanced neural networks to deliver high-accuracy ship fuel consumption forecasts."
