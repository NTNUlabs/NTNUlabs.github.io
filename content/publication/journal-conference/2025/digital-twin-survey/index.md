abstract: "Digital twin (DT) technology, which creates virtual representations of physical systems to optimize their life-cycle, has drawn significant attention across various industries. The automotive and aviation industries have been pioneers in adopting DTs for enhanced efficiency, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. However, the maritime industry, crucial to global trade and logistics, has lagged in DT implementation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized. In the automotive industry, DTs enhance vehicle efficiency and safety, particularly for autonomous and electric vehicles. Aviation DT research focuses on predictive maintenance, pilot training, and real-time monitoring to improve operational efficiency and safety. The maritime industry faces data challenges and operational complexity but has significant potential for DTs to enhance ship performance, safety, and predictive maintenance."
