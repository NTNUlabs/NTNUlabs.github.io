abstract: "The investigation of wave shielding effects holds significant importance for practical offshore operations. Utilizing the calm area on the lee side of the vessel enables operations to enhance safety and efficiency. Optimized vessel heading control reduces the relative motions in crane operations, thereby increasing the operational window. To achieve this, we conducted full-scale field experiment research with the research vessel Gunnerus, delivering more reliable and credible results to bridge the gap from simulations to real-world conditions. A detailed examination of experimental data and analysis reveals that when the ship encounters two short-crested waves with nearly 90° directional difference, the largest crane motion and optimal shelter effects occur when the vessel is beam-on to the stronger wave. Crane motion was more sensitive to wave attack angles than to the amplitude of the shielded wave. Specifically, positioning the vessel between 165° and 180° relative to the stronger wave minimized wave elevation in the sheltered zone and reduced vertical crane movements. Additionally, headings between 90° and 120° created a sufficiently calm area for efficient operations. These insights provide practical implications for optimizing vessel positioning and enhancing operational efficiency in challenging marine environments."
