abstract: |
  We propose an adaptive framework for continuous prediction of maritime vessel trajectories that dynamically incorporates changing environmental factors (e.g., currents, wind) and explicitly models prediction uncertainty. The method continuously updates its forecasts as new AIS data arrive, leveraging a hybrid of statistical filtering and deep learning techniques to maintain accuracy and robustness under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results on real-world voyage datasets demonstrate significant improvements in long-term prediction stability and quantified confidence bounds compared to baseline models.
summary: "A hybrid adaptive approach for real-time maritime trajectory forecasting with uncertainty quantification, presented at IEEE ICPS 2025."
