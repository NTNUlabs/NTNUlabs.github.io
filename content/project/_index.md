Demanding Marine Operations is a core of the maritime industry. Today, the time frame with a new design or an alternative procedure—such as anchor handling, platform supply, subsea installation, or buoy mooring—transferred to industrial and academic teams may easily extend to 2–3 years. Introducing a more simulation-driven design process, by developing simulator models alongside the design of new ships, procedures, or equipment, accelerates lessons learned and allows testing of more alternatives. This enhances the effectiveness of innovation processes typical for the Norwegian maritime cluster and strengthens regional education.

**Our project vision:**  
“A strong Norwegian maritime offshore industry through world-leading competence and knowledge in simulation-based design and complex maritime operations.”

**Primary objective:**  
To develop the next-generation simulator as an open, standardized framework for virtual prototyping of deck machinery—forming a new platform for maritime product development and operations.

### Goals of our research on maritime applications include:
- Contributing to strategic development at Aalesund University College as a key innovation hub.
- Advancing simulation techniques for demanding marine operations.
