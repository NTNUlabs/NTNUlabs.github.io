Demanding Marine Operations is a core of the maritime industry. Today, the time frame with a new design or an alternative procedure with respect to e.g. anchor handling, platform supply, subsea installation, or buoy mooring operation transferred to industrial and academic teams may easily be up to 2 – 3 years.

Introducing a more simulation-driven design process, by developing simulator models simultaneously with the design of a new ship, procedure or equipment, will accelerate lessons learned and allow more alternatives to be tested. Furthermore, this will improve the effectiveness of the prototype innovation processes, which is typical for the Norwegian maritime cluster, and strengthen the regional education.

Our project vision: “A strong Norwegian maritime offshore industry through world leading competence and knowledge in the fields of simulation based design and simulation of complex maritime operations”.

Primary objective: Develop next generation simulator as an open, standardized framework and architecture for virtual prototyping of deck machinery, which will be a new platform for product development and operations in the maritime industry.

Goals of our research on maritime applications include:
