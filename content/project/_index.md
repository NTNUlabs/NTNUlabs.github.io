### Overview

Demanding Marine Operations is a core of the maritime industry. Today, the time frame with a new design or an alternative procedure—such as anchor handling, platform supply, subsea installation, or buoy mooring—transferred to industrial and academic teams may easily extend to 2–3 years. Introducing a more simulation-driven design process, by developing simulator models alongside the design of new ships, procedures, or equipment, accelerates lessons learned and allows testing of more alternatives. This enhances the effectiveness of innovation processes typical for the Norwegian maritime cluster and strengthens regional education.

**Our project vision:**  
“A strong Norwegian maritime offshore industry through world-leading competence and knowledge in simulation-based design and complex maritime operations.”

**Primary objective:**  
To develop the next-generation simulator as an open, standardized framework for virtual prototyping of deck machinery—forming a new platform for maritime product development and operations.

### Goals of our research on maritime applications include:

- Contribute to the strategic development at Aalesund University College towards a key actor for innovation, testing, and training in demanding marine operations.  
- Enable the industry to implement simulation-based deck machinery design, enable more efficient communication between the customer, designer and product developer throughout the design process.  
- Promote research competence of NTNU in Ålesund with cooperated national and international partners, and strengthen research activity in the university colleges’ demanding maritime operation areas of expertise and academic responsibility.  
- Promote educational competence of NTNU in Ålesund on MSc and PhD level. Training of PhD candidates and MSc students within the scope of the project is a prioritized activity, to make a significant contribution to the academic and industrial cluster’s ability to achieve their objectives in terms of knowledge generation, recruitment of PhD and MSc candidates, and international collaboration.
